📚 How to Use

1)Open the live demo or run the project locally.
2)Enter a list of comma-separated numbers (e.g., 4,3,2,1,5).
3)Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort).
4)Click on Start Sorting to watch the sorting process step-by-step.

🛠️ Algorithms Implemented

1)Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.
2)Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted list one element at a time by picking each element and placing it in the correct position.
3)Selection Sort: Finds the smallest element in the list and places it in the sorted portion of the list, repeating until sorted.


📈 Future Improvements

1)Add more sorting algorithms, such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
2)Enhance UI with animations for a smoother user experience.
3)Allow users to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
